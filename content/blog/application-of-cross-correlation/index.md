During my studies in engineering, my curiosity often led me to explore the real-world applications of the concepts I was learning. I was particularly fascinated by cross-correlation in signals and systems and wanted to understand how this technique is used in practical situations. This desire to see how theoretical concepts are applied in real life helped me gain a deeper understanding of the theory itself. By exploring how cross-correlation, a mathematical method for comparing signals, is utilized in various technologies, I was able to connect the dots between theory and practice, making the concepts clearer and more meaningful to me.

## Cross correlation for continuous signals

Equation of cross correlation for continuous signals
If you have two signals, f(t) and ùëî(ùë°), the cross-correlation between them is defined as

$$
(f * g)(\tau) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t) \cdot g(t + \tau) \, dt
$$

## Cross correlation for descreate time and descreate amplitude
Equation of cross correlation for continuous signals
If you have two signals, f(t) and ùëî(ùë°), the cross-correlation between them is defined as

$$
r_{xy}[k] = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} x[n] \cdot y[n+k]
$$
